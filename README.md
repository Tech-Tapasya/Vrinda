## Run
<div>
<p>To run this application, you have to set your own environmental variables. For security reasons, some variables have been hidden from view and used as environmental variables with the help of dotenv package. Below are the variables that you need to set in order to run the application:</p>

<p>ATLASDB_URL: this is the connection string of your MongoDB Atlas database.</p>

<p>SECRET: a secret message for the session. You can use any string here.</p>

<p>KEY_ID, KEY_SECRET: the razorpay package is used to process payment in the checkout route. To get these, you should set up a razorpay account and put your private API key here.</p>

<p>CLOUD_NAME, CLOUD_API_KEY, CLOUD_API_SECRET: Cloudinary is a cloud-based platform that helps store, manage and deliver images and videos for websites and mobile apps. To get these, you should set up a Cloudinary account and put your private API key here </p>

<p>PHONEPE_MERCHANT_ID, SALT_KEY, PHONE_PE_HOST_URL, SALT_INDEX: To get these, you should go to this <a href="https://developer.phonepe.com/">documentation</a> and put those API key here.</p>

<p>ADMIN_COOKIE_NAME, ADMIN_COOKIE_PASSWORD: the cookie name and password used in the AdminBro authentication method. You can put any strings here.</p>

<p>After you've set these environmental variables in the .env file at the root of the project, you need to navigate to the "init" folder and run "node index.js" to fill your empty MongoDB Atlas database.</p>

<p>Now you can run "npm start" in the terminal and the application should work.</p>
